#### cmpt 414 final project
By: Kier Lindsay

## Into
This is a computer vision project atempting to convert normal photos to 2d art assests whitch can be used in games or as icons.  The Concept is to use image proccesing tequneaques to smooth and stylize images and then perfrome edge detection.  With these edges we can then atempt to create simple game objects or sprites with transparent backgrounds. In this project I will exparement with existing methods and atemt to make a web app that can create nice assets from a photo

## Modivation
I decided on this project becuse of my intrest in game design but lack of artistic skill.  I think it would be grate if I could make simple artsy assits by just taking a photo of the object I wish to use, and having it be converted into code.
